Commonplaces
============
Commonplaces, from the Latin *communes loci*, are extracts of reading. Compiling notebooks with copied out bits of reading for later recycling is a time-tested scholarly tradition, kept both for personal reference and for communal use and advancement.

While commonplacing is a method that historically applies to books and writing, it also can be updated to refer to repositories, forking, and the language of communal coding. **GitHub** seems to be a perfect platform to encourage commonplacing in every sense of the word.


### Commonplace Books
Francis Daniel Pastorius, *The Beehive*:
>For as much as our Memory is not Capable to retain al remarkable Words, Phrases, Sentences or Matters of Moment, which we do hear and read, It becomes every good Scholars to have a Common Place Book, & therein to Treasure up what ever deserves his Notice…

Seneca, Letter 84 (To Lucilius), describing the connection between commonplacing, and bees (the inspiration to Pastorius calling his book a *Beehive*):
> We ought not to only write nor only read; one thing depresses and drains men (I speak about writing), the other will loosen and refresh. Alternatively, it must be gone back and forth from this to that in turns, so that whatever is collected by reading, the stylus may render in form. We should imitate the bees, as they say, which wander and pluck suitable flowers to make honey, then carry whatever, they arrange and distribute through the honeycomb, just as our Virgil said: '. . . they pack close the/ liquid honey and fill the storehouse/with sweet nectar.'
> 
> It is not well established concerning the bees whether they make the juice from the flowers which becomes honey at once, or whether they change anything they have collected into this flavor by means of a certain mixture and the property of their breath. For it is pleasing to the writers that knowledge of honey-making does not belong to the bees, but the knowledge of collecting does.
>
>[…]We should imitate these bees and also separate whatever we have collected from different readings (for things that are separated are preserved better), then to combine with the care and ability of our mind having been applied these various offerings into one flavor, so that even now if it is apparent from where it was acquired, yet it is apparent that it is something other than from where it came.



### History


Christopher Hill, *The World Turned Upside Down*: 
>History has to be rewritten in every generation, because although the past does not change the present does; each generation asks new questions of the past, and finds new areas of sympathy as it re-lives different aspects of the experiences of its predecessors.
