Quakerville
===========

Documents and appendices relating to a dissertation on Quaker networks of publication (1680-1730), the exchange of books and manuscripts between communities in London and Philadelphia, and what they have to tell us about the role of print and manuscript in community-building.

The purpose of this **repository**:
  1. To familiarize myself with GitHub in all its glory.
  2. To keep my research methods transparent and easily accessible.
  
What to Expect
==============

Manifold mistakes:
  1. **In Content**: Typos, poorly sourced comments, half-finished thoughts.
  2. **In Form:** Inefficient ways of representing information, rookie idiocy.
  
Why? Because this is an experiment/learning experience.

> *"Truth more easily comes out of error than out of confusion."*   
Francis Bacon, quoted by Thomas Huxley.

Resources
=========

I found combining ProfHacker's tutorials with Git Hub's official book itself to be the best way of diving into this experiment.
I use [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com).

1. **Git Book**: [The Whole Thing](http://git-scm.com/book)
2. **ProfHacker**: [GitHub 101](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/tag/github101)
3. **Code School**: [Try Git](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) for help with walking the command line.
4. **Git Immersion**: [A super tutorial](http://gitimmersion.com)
5. **Git Reference**: [For quick reference](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)
