Quakerville
===========

Documents relating to a dissertation on 17th century Quaker publishing.

The purpose of this **repository**:
  1. To familiarize myself with GitHub in all its glory.
  2. To keep my research transparent and easily accessible.
  
What to Expect
==============

Manifold mistakes:
  1. **In Content**: Typos, poorly sourced comments, half-finished thoughts.
  2. **In Form:** Inefficient ways of representing information, rookie idiocy.
  
Why? Because this is an experiment/learning experience.

> *"Truth more easily comes out of error than out of confusion."*   
Francis Bacon, quoted by Thomas Huxley.

Resources
=========

I found combining ProfHacker's tutorials with Git Hub's official book itself to be the best way of diving into this experiment.
I use [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com).

1. **Git Book**: [The Whole Thing](http://git-scm.com/book)
2. **ProfHacker**: [GitHub 101](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/tag/github101)
