## [QUAKER LEADERS](#a1)
1. **William Penn**: (1644-1718) Prominent Quaker leader and proprieter of the religiously tolerant colony of Pennsylvania.
2. **George Fox**: (1624-1691) The Founder of the Quaker Movement in the early 1650s.
3. **Benjamin Furly**: Rotterdam-based Quaker, who crucially translated texts into Dutch and German for Quaker communities on the Continent. Also translated the majority of William Penn's promotional literature encouraging oppressed religious groups to emigrate to Philadelphia.
4. **Margaret Fell Fox**: (1614-1702) George Fox's wife, a prominent Quaker leader, who introduced pacifism into the movement's system of beliefs.
5. **Francis Daniel Pastorius**: (1651-1720) Founder of Germantown (1683), the first German settlement in the Pennsylvania colony. For more on Pastorius, his reading habits, and his massive commonplace book "The Beehive", see my undergraduate dissertation, *“What the Bees Have Taken Pains For:” Francis Daniel Pastorius, The Beehive, and Commonplacing in Colonial Pennsylvania*(2009), available on **ScholarlyCommons**: [http://repository.upenn.edu/uhf_2009/7/](http://repository.upenn.edu/uhf_2009/7/). *The Beehive* (**MS Codex 726**) is available in digital facsimile as a part of the University of Pennsylvania's *Penn in Hand* digitization project [http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/medren/2487547](http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/medren/2487547).
6. **Thomas Lloyd**: Early immigrant to the Pennsylvania Quaker community and good friend of Pastorius.
7. **~~George Keith~~**: (1638/9-1716) Influential Quaker minister turned enemy: after migrating to Pennsylvania Keith kicked off one of the most bitter internal controversies to rock the Quaker community, insisting that Quakers must all agree to a written doctrine of beliefs. He was outsted by the community, whose leaders (including Thomas Lloyd and Francis Daniel Pastorius) argued that a fixed doctrine contradicted the Quaker belief in **Inner Light**, godliness found in every person that need not require knowledge of the scriptures to be lived (or in the very least articulated).
8. **~~Thomas Budd~~**: A follower of George Keith, also an important mediator between the Quakers and the local Delaware Tribe - Budd provided the translation of the local chief Ockanickon's dying words and wrote about early colonist-native relations in *Good Order Established in Pennsilvania and New Jersey in America* (Philadelphia, 1685).
*Strikethrough indicates a break with the Quaker community*

## [QUAKER PRINTERS](#a2)
1. **William Bradford**: The first printer in Philadelphia, who relocated to New York (where he was the first officially appointed printer to the state) after the Keithian Controversy, during which time he had insisted on printing tracts on both sides of the debate (and consequently was sued by Quaker leaders).
2. **Giles Calvert**: Early printer to the Quakers, before the Morning Meeting established in 1672 that it would keep publication within the confession.
3. **Benjamin Clark**: Quaker Printer
4. **Luke Hinde**: One time apprentice to Tace Sowle, who took over the Sowle printing dynasty after her death in 1749.
5. **Andrew Sowle**: The most prominent printer to the Friends.
6. **Tace Sowle**: Andrew's oldest daughter, who inherited his business as early as 1691, was made free of the Stationers' Co in 1695, and trebled the business's profits (whilst significantly increasing its output).
7. **Jane Sowle**: Andrew's wife, under whose imprint Tace Sowle printed for twenty yeras.
8. **Elizabeth Sowle** Andrew's youngest daughter, apprenticed in printing, who married William Bradford and emigrated to Philadelphia.
